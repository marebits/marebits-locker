# Mare Bits Locker

[Mare Bits Locker](https://locker.mare.biz/) is a way to lock-up your [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), or [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens and keep them safe from that waifu thief Brad.  The contract issues a non-fungible token (NFT) that represents your deposit and allows whoever owns that token after a pre-determined length of time to withdraw the locked funds.  Once locked, ***your tokens cannot be withdrawn until the lock period has expired*** no matter what.  So, be careful!

This was created to facilitate the locking of liquidity tokens as part of the launch of Mare Bits ($MARE).  For more information on that project, see [https://mare.biz/](https://mare.biz/).  In order to make the code easily reviewable by others, I've released it here.

This should work for all tokens that implement either the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), or [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) interfaces, including [ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

Emits the `TokensLocked` event and returns the `accountId` when successful.</dd>

<dt><code>getAccount(uint256 accountId) returns (Account.Info)</code></dt>
<dd>Returns the account details for the account `accountId`.  These details include the `accountId`, the `amount` of tokens locked, the `tokenId` of the token locked, the `tokenContract` address, the `tokenType` locked, the `unlockTime`, whether or not the locker token `isBurned`, and whether or not the locker token `isRedeemed`.</dd>

### Mare Bits Locker Token
This contract represents the ERC-721 token issued when tokens are locked.  As such, it extends all the functions and events from the [ERC-721 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification).

#### Functions
`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
: Gives permission to `to` to transfer token `tokenId` to another account.  The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.  Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the [zero address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) clears previous approvals.  Emits an `Approval` event when successful.

`balanceOf(address owner) returns (uint256)`
: Returns the number of Mare Bits Locker tokens held by address `owner`.

`bestPony() returns (string)`
: Returns the best pony.

`burn(uint256 tokenId)`
: Can only be called by the owner of the token `tokenId` or someone the owner has approved.  This will burn the locker token, in effect sending it to the [zero address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).  If this is called, the token will disappear and any tokens locked in the locker will be unredeemable!  Emits a `Transfer` event when successful.

`getApproved(uint256 tokenId) returns (address)`
: Returns the account approved to transfer token `tokenId`.

`isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) returns (bool)`
: Returns true if the `operator` is allowed to manage all of the assets of `owner`.

`name() returns (string)`
: Returns the general name of this token (Mare Bits Locker Token).

`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) returns (address)`
: Returns the address that owns the token `tokenId`.

`safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
: Safely transfers token `tokenId` from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients are aware of the ERC-721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.  Emits a `Transfer` event when successful.

`setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool _approved)`
: Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller.  Operators can call `transferFrom` or `safeTransferFrom` for any token owned by the caller.  Emits an `ApprovalForAll` event when successful.

`supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) returns (bool)`
: See [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-a-contract-will-publish-the-interfaces-it-implements).

`symbol() returns (string)`
: Returns the general symbol of this token (🐎‍♀️🔒🪙).

`tokenByIndex(uint256 index) returns (uint256)`
: REturns a token ID at a given `index` of all Mare Bit Locker Tokens.  Use along with `totalSupply` to enumerate all tokens.

`tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index) returns (uint256)`
: Returns a token ID owned by `owner` at a given `index` of its token list.  Use along with `balanceOf` to enumerate all of `owner`'s tokens.

`tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`
: Returns the URI containing metadata for the token `tokenId`.  This is used by sites to display metadata for this NFT.

`totalSupply() returns (uint256)`
: Returns the total amount of Mare Bit Locker Tokens.

`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
: Transfers token `tokenId` from `from` to `to`.  Emits a `Transfer` event when successful.

#### Events
`Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)`
: Emitted when `owner` enabled `approved` to manager the token `tokenId`.

`ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)`
: Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manager all of its assets.

`Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
: Emitted when token `tokenId` is transferred from `from` to `to`.

`URI(string value, uint256 indexed id)`
: Emitted when the URI of the token `id` has changed to `value`.

#### Errors
`NotApprovedOrOwner(uint256 tokenId)`
: Thrown when attempted to transfer a token the caller does not own or is not approved to transfer.

`NotLockerOwner(address claimedOwner, address actualOwner)`
: Thrown when attempted to make a call that only the owner of this contract's owner can make.

### Mare Bits Vault
#### Functions
`bestPony() returns (string)`
: Returns the best pony.

`onERC1155BatchReceived(address operator, address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values, bytes data) returns (bytes4)`
