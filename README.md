# Mare Bits Locker

Mare Bits Locker is a non-fungible token that allows users to lock their other existing Ethereum tokens for a pre-determined length of time.  Once your tokens are locked, you are issued an ERC721 token.  This token can be used to retrieve your tokens after the unlock period has expired.

This was originally created to facilitate the locking of liquidity tokens as part of the launch of Mare Bits ($MARE).  For more information on that project, see [https://mare.biz/](https://mare.biz/).  Since I figured it could be of use to some others, I've released the source code here.
